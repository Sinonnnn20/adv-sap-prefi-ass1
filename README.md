## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- Microservices is like a cool way of doing software stuff for a whole big company. so, there's these reusable software thingies called services, and each one's got code and data stuff mashed together to do specific business things, like checking if a customer's credit is good or logging into a website or handling a mortgage application.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Standardized Service Contracts are like rules that services must follow. These contracts serve to describe what services are meant to do.

- Loose Coupling in services is about avoiding tight dependencies.

- Abstraction in services is like keeping secrets. Services hide the technical details, dodge information overload, and keep things straightforward.

- Service Reusability is when they split up the complicated stuff into services, aiming to use it over and over again

- Autonomy in services refers to the ability of services to control their own logic independently.

- Statelessness in services is the idea that they ideally shouldn't carry any baggage.

- Discoverability in services involves the ability to be found, typically in a service registry.

- Composability in services is about breaking down complex issues into smaller ones, aligning with the Reusability principle. 

- Interoperability in services involves using standards that enable diverse users to access and utilize the service. 
 
3. Define Microservices.
- I think microservices are kind of like building things in a chill way with pieces that aren't super attached. It's not like the old-school deal of using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for the whole company. Microservices are more about doing one application at a time, making it more nimble, scalable, and tough.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- independently deployable microservices offer a relaxed approach to building things, using loosely connected components.

-  right tool for the job traditional architecture pattern has limitations, especially in sharing a common stack and database for the entire application. 

-  microservices allow for precise scaling by enabling the individual deployment and scaling of specific services.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- Difference is that SOA is less flexible due to common standards and shared infrastracture and microservices are more flexible because each service can use its own tech stack and the similarity is both approaches involve breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable components.
